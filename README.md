# LoanDAO
Decentralizing the future of loans.

LoanDAO is a glimpse of what is possible with Stacks as we believe that it can be used to power decentralized loans in the future. 

The goal is to have the LoanDAO smart contract serve as a north star for new models of accessing capital in a decentralized way. 

Initial funding for startups or projects can be difficult to acquire but with the power of Stacks, startups or projects can obtain a loan from a DAO and then pays it back with interest every 30 days until the loan is repaid in full. 

NoCodeClarity believes in the power of Bitcoin and Stacks so it's important that LoanDAO is open source, especially as a hackathon submission for the [2023 Building on Bitcoin Hackathon](https://building-on-btc-hack.devpost.com/).
